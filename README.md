python-ternary
==============

This is a plotting library for use with matplotlib to allow ternary plots,
plots in the two dimensional simplex projected onto a two dimensional plane.

The library provides functions for plotting curves (trajectories) and heatmaps.

Minimal example:

> from maplotlib import pyplot
>
> import ternary
>
> ax = ternary.draw_boundary()
>
> pyplot.show()
